## ⚙️ Real-World Problem Statement

As a .NET developer, transitioning to Java—specifically to build an application using **Kafka Streams**—presents a steep learning curve. Beyond the language shift, Java’s build ecosystem introduces additional complexity. **Maven** (or Gradle) is essential for dependency management, compilation, and packaging, but can feel unintuitive and overly verbose, especially compared to .NET’s MSBuild and NuGet.

Key challenges include:

* Understanding the structure and purpose of `pom.xml` in Maven.
* Resolving transitive dependencies and managing conflicts.
* Building runnable JARs (especially Uber JARs for Kafka Streams).
* Dealing with Java’s fragmented logging ecosystem (e.g. SLF4J, Logback, Log4j).
* Navigating the use of plugins for running, packaging, and shading Java applications.

These layers of complexity can make what should be a simple Kafka Streams app feel disproportionately hard to get off the ground.
